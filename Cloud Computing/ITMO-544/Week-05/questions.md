## Chapter 03 - Selecting a Service Platform 

### 1. Compare IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS on the basis of cost, configurability, and control.

Cost:
*Iaas helps in eliminating cost of setting up infra or data center. You pay for storage, network and usage. Investment required for platform setup and maintenance, application development and maintenance. 
*Paas has along with infra you can lower cost of platform setup, maintenance and patching. It operates on pay-per use.
*Saas has no infra cost, no platform cost and zero software development or maintenance cost. It is pay-per user. 

Control:
*Iaas has full control of system and data. You can easily add remove hardware as needed
*Paas has control for your systems and data. You may or may not have full access to system components
*Saas has no control of system. Very limited access to system libraries until exposed by provider. 

configurability:
*Iaas can configure full system as per your need and requirements. 
*Paas is very limited configurable but not expandable at all.  
*Saas has no scope of configuration until and unless huge business impact for provider. 



### 2. What are the caveats to consider in adopting Software as a Service?
        *Ease of use of the service
        *Service accessibility from anywhere
        *Architectural and security decisions
        *Accessibility to new releases 
        *Data privacy, application hosting policies, upgrades and operational details


### 3. List the key advantages of virtual machines.
      *They are fast to create and destroy
      *They are programmable
      *They can be moved between different phisical machines
      *They are isolated at the OS level

### 4. Why might you choose physical over virtual machines?
   *Steal time management mechanism is poor for virtual machines while its better for physical machines.
   * Running different virtual machines in one physical machine for computation is heavy while single OS in terms of physical machine can offer better computation at times.
   * Physical machines offer better disk I/O and optimal network usage.
   * Hardware accesibility is better for physical machine than virtual machine.


### 5. Which factors might make you choose private over public cloud services?
      *Compliance: Companies are governed by regulations that depend on the businness, size, locations and private or public status. Companies that offer public cloud can fail an audit of these regulations.
      *Privacy: in a public cloud the data and code reside on some on someone else's equipment. This supposes some risks as accidental exposure of the data.
      *Cost: If the need of an infrastructure to save data is big or long term, it is less expensive to have a private cloud service.
      *Control: a private cloud affords more control: hardware, network topology, providing any feature, etc


### 6. Which selection strategy does your current organization use? What are the benefits and caveats of using this strategy?
      *IIT is using SaaS Google Apps provided by google for productivity tools such as email, google drive, google docs etc.
      #### advantages
      * University uses Google infrastructure
      *Google provide Support when required
      ####Disadvantage
      ** OTS should take care of training and enabling people to work on google apps internal support.
