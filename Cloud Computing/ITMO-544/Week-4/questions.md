## Chapter 02 - Designing for Operations

### 1. Why is design for operations so important?
   * In full life cycle of any software or system operations is the biggest cycle. Hence optimal operations design is important.
   * A good design for operations is cost effective and increases productivity of any organization or team.
   * System will be more reliable, stable and consistent.


### 2. How is automated configuration typically supported?
   * Using Text files
   * Binary blob files
   * Using API
   * From source code repository


### 3. List the important factors for redundancy through replication.
- It improves the speed of replies. There are more read access than write access.
- It supports database scaling 
- It provides a backup
- Efficient against database overload


### 4. Give an example of a partially implemented process in your current environment. What would you do to fully implement it?
To imrpove a process I would apply ISO 9001 (simplifying i.e Plan-Do-Check-Act). Always there must be a continuous review of the process to detect errors and lacks and to improve it.


### 5. Why might you not want to solve an issue by coding the solution yourself?
For so many reasons:
- Every company has its own coding standard, internal infrastructure and overall vision of the future software architecture.
- Bugs in your code may result in developers not taking any responsibility for even their piece of code
- Developers may not need to care about operational features 


### 6. Which type of problems should appear first on your priority list?
Those with higher impact should be first, starting with those who are easier to implement.


### 7. Which factors can you bring to an outside vendor to get the vendor to take your issue seriously?
- Being constructive: vendors are sensitive to criticism of their products
- Use the vendor's software actively
